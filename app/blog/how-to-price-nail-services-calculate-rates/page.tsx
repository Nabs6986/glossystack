          If you're charging based on what other techs in your area charge, you're probably underpricing your work. The nail tech down the street might be losing money on every set—matching her prices means you lose money too. Here's how to calculate what your services actually cost, set rates that let you profit, and confidently raise prices as you grow.
        </p>

        <p>
          The formula isn't complicated. Most nail techs just never do the math. Let's fix that.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Most Nail Techs Underprice</h2>

        <p>
          New nail techs commonly set prices this way: look at Instagram, find techs in their area, 
          pick a number slightly lower than average because they're "still building a book."
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach ignores your actual costs. It ignores how long the service takes you (which 
          affects how many clients you can see per day). It ignores product waste. And it definitely 
          ignores the unpaid hours you spend on admin, cleaning, inventory, and marketing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Result: you're exhausted, your hands hurt, you did six sets today, and somehow you barely 
          made enough to cover rent. Sound familiar?
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Step 1: Calculate Your Real Costs</h2>

        <p>
          Before setting prices, you need to know what each service actually costs you in supplies.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Fixed Costs (Monthly)</h3>

        <p>
          These are expenses you pay whether you have zero clients or fifty:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Rent/booth rental:</strong> $500-2,000/month depending on location</li>
          <li><strong>Booking software:</strong> $24-50/month (<a href="/software/glossgenius" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">GlossGenius</a>, <a href="/software/vagaro" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Vagaro</a>, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Phone/internet:</strong> $50-100/month</li>
          <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> $20-50/month</li>
          <li><strong>Continuing education:</strong> $50-200/month (averaged—classes, supplies to practice)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Add these up. Let's say your total fixed costs are $800/month.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Variable Costs (Per Service)</h3>

        <p>
          These are supplies consumed for each service:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Acrylic powder/monomer:</strong> $3-5 per full set</li>
          <li><strong>Gel polish:</strong> $1-3 per manicure</li>
          <li><strong>Tips/forms:</strong> $1-3 per full set</li>
          <li><strong>Disposable supplies:</strong> Files, buffers, cotton, alcohol, etc. ($2-4 per service)</li>
          <li><strong>Nail art supplies:</strong> $0-10 depending on complexity</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For a standard acrylic full set with basic nail art, your supply cost is probably $8-15. 
          For a gel manicure, maybe $4-6.
        </p>

        <p>
          Track this for a month if you've never calculated it. Many techs are shocked to learn 
          their product costs are higher than they assumed.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Hidden Costs Most Techs Forget</h3>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Payment processing fees:</strong> 2.6-2.9% of every card payment</li>
          <li><strong>No-show losses:</strong> Even with deposits, you lose some income to cancellations</li>
          <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Self-employment tax is 15.3% before income tax</li>
          <li><strong>Health insurance:</strong> If you're buying your own, factor this in</li>
          <li><strong>Unpaid time:</strong> Cleaning, restocking, admin, marketing, social media</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Step 2: Calculate Your Required Hourly Rate</h2>

        <p>
          Here's the formula:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
          <p className="font-mono text-sm mb-4">
            Required Hourly Rate = (Target Annual Income + Fixed Costs + Taxes) ÷ Billable Hours
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Example Calculation</h3>

        <p>
          Let's say you want to make $60,000/year take-home (after taxes and costs). Here's how 
          that breaks down:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Target take-home:</strong> $60,000</li>
          <li><strong>Fixed costs:</strong> $800/month × 12 = $9,600/year</li>
          <li><strong>Self-employment tax:</strong> ~$9,000/year (on $60k)</li>
          <li><strong>Income tax:</strong> ~$8,000/year (varies by state)</li>
          <li><strong>Total needed:</strong> $86,600/year</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Now, how many hours can you actually bill? If you work 50 weeks/year, 5 days/week, 8 
          hours/day—that's 2,000 hours. But you won't bill all of them.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Breaks, cleaning between clients, admin: subtract 20%</li>
          <li>Cancellations and gaps in schedule: subtract 10%</li>
          <li><strong>Realistic billable hours:</strong> ~1,400/year</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Required hourly rate:</strong> $86,600 ÷ 1,400 = $62/hour
        </p>

        <p>
          That's before adding product costs. If supplies average $10 per service and services 
          average 90 minutes, add $6.67/hour. Your all-in rate needs to be about <strong>$69/hour</strong> 
          to hit your income goal.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Step 3: Convert to Service Prices</h2>

        <p>
          Now translate your hourly rate into service prices:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
          <table className="w-full text-left">
            <thead>
              <tr className="border-b">
                <th className="py-2">Service</th>
                <th className="py-2">Time</th>
                <th className="py-2">At $69/hr</th>
                <th className="py-2">Rounded Price</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr className="border-b">
                <td className="py-2">Full Set (Acrylic)</td>
                <td className="py-2">2 hours</td>
                <td className="py-2">$138</td>
                <td className="py-2 font-semibold">$140</td>
              </tr>
              <tr className="border-b">
                <td className="py-2">Fill</td>
                <td className="py-2">1.25 hours</td>
                <td className="py-2">$86</td>
                <td className="py-2 font-semibold">$85</td>
              </tr>
              <tr className="border-b">
                <td className="py-2">Gel Manicure</td>
                <td className="py-2">45 min</td>
                <td className="py-2">$52</td>
                <td className="py-2 font-semibold">$50</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td className="py-2">Nail Art (per nail)</td>
                <td className="py-2">5-10 min</td>
                <td className="py-2">$6-12</td>
                <td className="py-2 font-semibold">$5-10</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>
          Look at those numbers. If you're currently charging $60 for a full set that takes you 
          2 hours, you're working for $30/hour before costs. After supplies, rent, and taxes? 
          Maybe $15/hour. That's less than minimum wage in most states.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">"But That's More Than Other Techs Charge!"</h2>

        <p>
          Here's the thing: you don't want to compete on price. The cheapest nail tech in town 
          attracts clients who care most about price—and they'll leave you the moment someone 
          charges $5 less.
        </p>

        <p>
          Price communicates value. A $120 full set signals quality, expertise, attention to detail. 
          A $45 full set signals "I'll take anything." Which client do you want in your chair for 
          two hours?
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Market Rate vs. Profitable Rate</h3>

        <p>
          If your calculated rate is significantly higher than local competitors, you have options:
        </p>

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Work faster</strong> (without sacrificing quality)—if you can do a full set in 90 minutes instead of 2 hours, your hourly rate increases automatically</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce costs</strong>—find better product pricing, cheaper rent, share space</li>
          <li><strong>Differentiate</strong>—specialize in a style that commands premium pricing (Russian manicure, intricate nail art, specific techniques)</li>
          <li><strong>Accept lower income</strong>—but at least do it knowingly, not by accident</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          What you should NOT do: price low and hope to "make it up in volume." Volume just means 
          more exhaustion at the same low rate.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">How to Raise Your Prices</h2>

        <p>
          If you've been undercharging, raising prices feels scary. Here's how to do it without 
          losing all your clients:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">1. Give Advance Notice</h3>

        <p>
          Two to four weeks before the increase, post on Instagram, send a text, or tell clients at 
          their appointment: "Starting [date], my prices will increase by $X. This reflects the quality 
          of work and products I use. I value you as a client and wanted to give you advance notice."
        </p>

        <p>
          Most clients expect periodic price increases. It's normal. Don't apologize—just inform.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">2. Raise Prices for New Clients First</h3>

        <p>
          If raising across the board feels too aggressive, start by updating your booking page with 
          new prices for new clients. Existing clients keep their current rate for 60-90 days, then 
          transition to new pricing.
        </p>

        <p>
          This rewards loyalty while gradually moving everyone to profitable rates.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">3. Increase Incrementally</h3>

        <p>
          If you need to raise prices by $30, consider doing it in two $15 increments six months apart. 
          Smaller increases are less noticeable and give clients time to adjust.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">4. Let Some Clients Go</h3>

        <p>
          Some clients will leave. That's okay. If someone can only afford your old (unprofitable) rate, 
          they weren't a sustainable client anyway. Better to have 15 clients paying $120 than 20 clients 
          paying $60.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll work less, make the same (or more), and have energy left at the end of the day.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Price Add-Ons Properly</h2>

        <p>
          Nail art, removals, repairs, and add-ons should all have clear pricing. Don't absorb 
          extra work into the base price.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Common Add-On Pricing</h3>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Nail art (per nail):</strong> $3-15 depending on complexity</li>
          <li><strong>Extension removal:</strong> $15-30</li>
          <li><strong>Gel polish removal:</strong> $10-15</li>
          <li><strong>Nail repair:</strong> $5-10 per nail</li>
          <li><strong>Chrome/specialty finish:</strong> $10-20</li>
          <li><strong>Extra length:</strong> $10-20</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Your booking software should list these as add-ons clients can select. <a href="/software/glossgenius" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">GlossGenius</a> and <a href="/software/vagaro" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Vagaro</a> 
          both handle add-on pricing well—clients see the additional cost before booking.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Tracking Whether Your Prices Work</h2>

        <p>
          After setting new prices, monitor:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Booking rate:</strong> Are you filling your schedule? If you're booked out 2+ weeks, prices might still be too low.</li>
          <li><strong>Client retention:</strong> Are existing clients rebooking? Some churn after price increases is normal; mass exodus means you raised too fast.</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue per hour:</strong> This is the key metric. If you're hitting your target hourly rate, your prices are working.</li>
          <li><strong>Exhaustion level:</strong> Are you ending days with energy? Proper pricing means working sustainably, not running yourself into the ground.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Most booking platforms show reports on revenue and services. Review monthly. If you're 
          consistently under your target hourly rate, something needs to change—prices, speed, or 
          costs.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The Confidence Factor</h2>

        <p>
          Here's what nobody tells new nail techs: pricing is as much psychology as math.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you quote your prices hesitantly—"It's, um, $80... but I could maybe do $70 if 
          that's too much"—clients sense your uncertainty. They negotiate. They question value.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you state your prices confidently—"A full set is $120, and that includes up to two 
          nails of accent art"—clients accept it. Your confidence signals that this is what the 
          service costs because this is what it's worth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Do the math so you know your prices are fair. Then quote them without apology.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Summary: The Pricing Formula</h2>

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Calculate your fixed monthly costs</li>
          <li>Calculate your per-service supply costs</li>
          <li>Decide your target annual income</li>
          <li>Add taxes and costs to your target income</li>
          <li>Divide by realistic billable hours (not scheduled hours)</li>
          <li>Add per-service costs to get your required hourly rate</li>
          <li>Convert to service prices based on time per service</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          If the number is higher than you expected, that's good. Now you know why you've been 
          struggling financially despite working constantly. The math doesn't lie.
        </p>

        <p>
          Set prices that let you profit. Your work is worth it.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                Add your target income, fixed costs, and taxes, then divide by your realistic billable 
                hours. This gives your required hourly rate. Multiply by service time and add supply 
                costs. A 2-hour full set at $69/hour with $10 in supplies should cost at least $148—round

              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                Slightly lower is reasonable while building your portfolio and speed. But "discounted" 
                shouldn't mean "unprofitable." Price at the lower-middle of your market, not the bottom. 
                Raise prices as you get busier and faster.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">How often should nail techs raise prices?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                Review prices every 6-12 months. If you're booked out 2+ weeks consistently, prices are 
                too low. If product costs increase, raise prices to match. Small, regular increases 
                ($5-10) are better than rare large jumps.

                complexity: $5-10/nail. Intricate art: $10-20/nail. Never include complex nail art 
                in the base price—it devalues your skill.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                Give 2-4 weeks notice. Be direct and confident: "Starting [date], my prices will 
                increase to reflect the quality and value of my work." Don't apologize or 
                over-explain. Most clients expect periodic increases.
