          <a href="/software/glossgenius" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">GlossGenius</a> is the best booking software for mobile nail techs and home-based salons. At $24/month, it gives you professional booking pages, automatic text reminders, and payment processing from your phone—without the complexity of salon-focused software you don't need. For nail techs running their business from Instagram, the GlossGenius booking link works perfectly in your bio.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mobile and home-based nail techs have different needs than salon employees. You don't need chair rental management. You don't need team scheduling. You need clients to book easily, pay without friction, and show up on time.
        </p>

        <p>
          We tested the major booking platforms from the perspective of a solo nail tech—either traveling to clients or working from a home setup. Here's what actually works.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">What Mobile Nail Techs Actually Need</h2>

        <p>
          Before comparing apps, let's be clear about requirements. As a mobile or home-based nail tech, you need:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Online booking that works on phones</strong> — your clients book from Instagram, not desktops</li>
          <li><strong>Automatic reminders</strong> — no-shows kill your income when you only see 4-6 clients per day</li>
          <li><strong>Card payments</strong> — Venmo and Cash App don't let you collect deposits or charge no-show fees</li>
          <li><strong>Deposits or card-on-file</strong> — protection against last-minute cancellations</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile app you can run everything from</strong> — you're not sitting at a computer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Everything else—team calendars, inventory tracking, marketing campaigns—is noise. The right software handles the essentials beautifully.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">GlossGenius: Best Overall for Mobile Nail Techs</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="/software/glossgenius" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">GlossGenius</a> ($24/month Standard, $48/month Gold) was built for independent beauty professionals. The mobile app is genuinely excellent—everything you need is two taps away.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Why It Works for Mobile Techs</h3>

        <p>
          The booking page looks professional when shared on Instagram. You get a clean link (glossgenius.com/yourname) that clients tap, see your services with photos, and book instantly. No redirects to clunky third-party calendars.
        </p>

        <p>
          Automatic text reminders go out 24 hours and 2 hours before appointments. You don't have to manually message each client. No-shows dropped by 40-60% for most nail techs after implementing reminders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Payment processing is 2.6% flat—competitive with Square and better than most beauty software. You can accept cards in person with their free reader (Gold plan) or have clients pay when booking.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Deposits and No-Show Protection</h3>

        <p>
          This is where GlossGenius shines for mobile techs. You can require:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Deposits at booking:</strong> Charge 25%, 50%, or custom amount when clients book</li>
          <li><strong>Card on file:</strong> Store their card without charging until they no-show</li>
          <li><strong>No-show fees:</strong> Automatically charge the stored card if they don't show</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For mobile nail techs, this is essential. You drove 30 minutes to a client's home, set up your kit, and they didn't answer the door. Without deposit protection, that's a lost $80-$150 slot. With GlossGenius, you're at least covered.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Standard vs Gold: Which Tier?</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Standard ($24/month)</strong> includes everything most solo techs need: booking, payments, reminders, client management.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Gold ($48/month)</strong> adds: free card reader, website builder, email marketing, and financial reports. Worth it if you want a standalone website without paying for Squarespace separately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Start with Standard. Upgrade to Gold if you outgrow it.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">The Downside</h3>

        <p>
          GlossGenius doesn't have a true free tier. You're paying $24/month from day one. For brand-new techs still building clientele, that monthly cost adds up before you're busy enough to justify it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Fresha: Best Free Option</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="/software/fresha" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Fresha</a> costs $0/month—genuinely free. You pay only when transactions happen: 2.79% + $0.20 on payments, plus a 20% fee when new clients book through their marketplace.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Why Mobile Techs Like Fresha</h3>

        <p>
          When you're doing 10-15 appointments per month while building your book, $0/month is better than $24/month. Fresha lets you test booking software without commitment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The core features are solid:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Online booking with shareable link</li>
          <li>Automatic email and SMS reminders</li>
          <li>Client database</li>
          <li>Basic reporting</li>
          <li>Payment processing built in</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">The Catch</h3>

        <p>
          Fresha's marketplace fee is steep. When a new client books through Fresha's search (not your direct link), you pay 20% of that first service. If someone finds you through Fresha's discovery feature and books a $100 full set, Fresha takes $20.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is fine if you're driving all your own bookings through Instagram—they only charge marketplace fees on Fresha-sourced clients. But if you're relying on Fresha to bring you new clients, that 20% adds up.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">When to Choose Fresha</h3>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>You're just starting and can't afford $24/month yet</li>
          <li>You're doing fewer than 20 appointments per month</li>
          <li>You drive your own bookings (Instagram, word of mouth) and won't rely on their marketplace</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Once you're consistently doing 30+ appointments monthly, switch to GlossGenius or Vagaro—the flat monthly fee becomes cheaper than Fresha's per-booking costs.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Square Appointments: Best for Product Sales</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="/software/square-appointments" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Square Appointments</a> is free for individuals and integrates with Square's retail ecosystem. If you sell nail polish, cuticle oil, or hand creams alongside services, Square handles both seamlessly.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Why Mobile Techs Consider Square</h3>

        <p>
          The free plan includes online booking, automatic reminders, and payment processing (2.6% + $0.10 per transaction). For solo operators, you're not paying monthly fees.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you upsell products at appointments—a bottle of cuticle oil, nail art accessories—Square's inventory and POS features are better than any beauty-specific platform.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Where Square Falls Short</h3>

        <p>
          Square wasn't designed for beauty professionals. The booking pages are functional but generic—they don't have the visual appeal of GlossGenius. You can't add service photos or showcase your portfolio directly on the booking page.
        </p>

        <p>
          Client management is basic. You get a contact list, not beauty-specific notes like nail shape preferences, gel vs. acrylic history, or allergy information.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">When to Choose Square</h3>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>You sell products alongside services</li>
          <li>You already use Square for another business</li>
          <li>You prioritize free over beauty-specific features</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Vagaro: Best Feature Set, Most Complex</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="/software/vagaro" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Vagaro</a> ($30/month for one user) offers the deepest feature set of any booking platform. The problem: most of it is designed for salons with employees, not solo mobile techs.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">What Vagaro Does Well</h3>

        <p>
          The marketplace is legitimate. Vagaro has 30+ million users searching for beauty services. If you're in a major metro, being listed on Vagaro can bring new clients without Instagram marketing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Features are exhaustive: booking, payments, email marketing, loyalty programs, gift cards, memberships, forms, waivers—everything a full salon needs.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Why It's Often Overkill</h3>

        <p>
          Mobile nail techs don't need team scheduling, chair rental management, or complex commission structures. Vagaro's interface reflects its salon focus—there are menus and settings you'll never touch.
        </p>

        <p>
          At $30/month, it costs more than GlossGenius ($24) for features most solo techs won't use. The marketplace value has to justify the extra cost.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">When to Choose Vagaro</h3>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>You want marketplace exposure in a competitive metro</li>
          <li>You plan to grow into a salon eventually and want software that scales</li>
          <li>You want features like memberships and gift cards from day one</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Setting Up for Mobile Work</h2>

        <p>
          Whichever platform you choose, these settings matter for mobile nail techs:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Add Travel Time Between Appointments</h3>

        <p>
          If you're driving to clients, you need buffer time. Set 30-60 minute gaps between appointment slots depending on your service area. GlossGenius, Fresha, and Vagaro all let you configure buffer time in settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without this, you'll end up double-booked or constantly running late.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Require Deposits for New Clients</h3>

        <p>
          New clients are higher no-show risk. Require a 50% deposit for first-time bookings. Existing clients with good history can book with card-on-file only.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Set Your Service Area</h3>

        <p>
          Make clear where you travel. List neighborhoods or zip codes in your bio or booking page. "Mobile nail services in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan below 96th St" sets expectations.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Add Travel Fees If Needed</h3>

        <p>
          Some mobile techs charge flat travel fees ($15-$25) or tiered fees based on distance. List these as separate add-ons in your booking system so clients see the total upfront.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Home Salon Considerations</h2>

        <p>
          If you work from a home studio rather than traveling, your needs shift slightly:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Address Privacy</h3>

        <p>
          You may not want your home address publicly searchable. GlossGenius lets you share your booking link without displaying your location until someone books. Send the address in the confirmation message, not on the public booking page.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Parking Instructions</h3>

        <p>
          Add parking details to your confirmation messages. Clients arriving frustrated because they couldn't find parking aren't in a good mood for their appointment.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">House Rules</h3>

        <p>
          Use the booking confirmation to communicate expectations: no children, mask requirements (if any), arrival time ("please text when you arrive rather than knocking"). This is easier to enforce when it's in writing.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The Instagram Connection</h2>

        <p>
          For most mobile nail techs, Instagram is your portfolio and your marketing. The booking software needs to integrate smoothly:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Link in bio:</strong> Your booking link should work perfectly in Instagram's in-app browser</li>
          <li><strong>Action button:</strong> Instagram lets you add a "Book" button directly to your profile (GlossGenius, Fresha, Square, and Vagaro all support this)</li>
          <li><strong>Story links:</strong> Share booking links in Stories for specific openings</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          GlossGenius booking pages are specifically optimized for Instagram sharing—they load fast, look professional, and don't require logging in to book. This matters when 80% of your traffic comes from Stories.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">My Recommendation</h2>

        <p>
          For most mobile nail techs and home salon owners:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Just starting (0-20 appointments/month):</strong> Start with <a href="/software/fresha" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Fresha</a>. The $0/month cost lets you build without overhead.</li>
          <li><strong>Established (20+ appointments/month):</strong> Switch to <a href="/software/glossgenius" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">GlossGenius</a>. The flat $24/month is cheaper than Fresha's per-booking fees at this volume.</li>
          <li><strong>Selling products alongside services:</strong> Use <a href="/software/square-appointments" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Square Appointments</a>. The retail integration justifies the less beauty-focused experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Want marketplace exposure:</strong> Consider <a href="/software/vagaro" className="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Vagaro</a>. The extra $6/month over GlossGenius buys you visibility in their marketplace.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Don't overcomplicate it. Pick one, set it up, and start booking clients. You can always switch later.

          <div className="space-y-6">
            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">What is the best free booking app for nail techs?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                Fresha is the best free booking app for nail techs. You pay $0/month—only payment processing fees when you accept cards. Square Appointments is also free for individuals but lacks beauty-specific features. Fresha includes reminders, client management, and booking pages at no monthly cost.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">Is GlossGenius worth $24/month for a solo nail tech?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                GlossGenius is worth it once you're doing 25+ appointments per month. The professional booking pages, automatic reminders, and no-show protection save you time and money. For brand-new techs still building clientele, Fresha's free tier might make more sense until you're busier.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">Should I require deposits for nail appointments?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                Yes. No-shows cost you money, especially as a mobile tech who may have traveled to the client. Require 25-50% deposits at booking, or at minimum, card-on-file with a no-show fee policy. Clients who push back on deposits aren't clients you want.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">How do I add a booking link to my Instagram?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                Put your booking link in your Instagram bio. For business accounts, you can also add an Action Button (tap Edit Profile → Action Buttons → Book Now) that links directly to your booking page. GlossGenius, Fresha, Vagaro, and Square all integrate with Instagram's booking button feature.

                Expect 2.6-2.8% per transaction for credit card payments. GlossGenius charges 2.6% flat. Square charges 2.6% + $0.10. Fresha charges 2.79% + $0.20. On a $100 service, you're paying $2.60-$3.00 in fees. Factor this into your pricing.
